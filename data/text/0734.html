        Major Challenges
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Global FCR is going through a period of rapid and deep change both internally and externally. Internally we are restructuring the Group's footprint, ensuring that these businesses are run consistently and globally. Steering a large regional FCR sub-function in such an environment is challenging by itself. However, there are additional challenges from internal restructuring of our business, major cost reviews and implementation of efficiency programmes. The immense amount of change internally and externally calls for the job holder to be alert and adaptable to:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * developing requirements, whilst also delivering challenging targets;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * managing the demands of multiple diverse aspects of the role;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * maintaining a global perspective, but with particular consideration of regional priorities (staff, budgets, resources, operations) and the impact of these, and ensuring a proportionate balance;
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * implementing and managing a uniform approach to operations, in view of disparate operating procedures already in operation (within the organization and within departments) and the unique issues, requirements and problems associated with each.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Role Context
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The jobholder is required to manage and lead the regional Intelligence and Analytics sub-function within FCTM and establish the policies and procedures of the Group in managing these risks. This can involve dealing with major issues for which there is no clear cut solution whilst still being able to provide judgment and clear direction. Where items of major consequence are involved, reference is made to the Global Head of Intelligence and Analytics or the regional head of FCTM or both as appropriate. The nature of the role requires close working contact with senior executives across FCR.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is a new position and function that the jobholder will be expected to further define and embed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Management of Risk
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The jobholder will continually reassess the operational risks associated with the role and inherent in the business, taking account of changing financial crimes threats, geopolitical, economic or market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, operating procedures and practices, management restructurings, and the impact of new technology. Monitor in accordance with the Principal Accountabilities set out above.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The jobholder will ensure the fair treatment of our customers is at the heart of everything we do, both personally and as an organization.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Observation of Internal Controls
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Maintains HSBC internal control standards, including timely implementation of internal and external audit points together with any issues raised by external regulators.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Jobholder is an 'insider' for dealing purposes and subject to strict controls and confidentiality.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Role Dimensions
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * The jobholder's responsibilities cover all of the Group's FCTM operations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Management of the Global Financial Crime Analysis function of approximately 250 staff and an annual AOP budget of over USD35m
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Significant executive experience leading a regulatory, investigative or intelligence agency, or as a senior compliance or technology manager within a global firm, in the financial services industry.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Deep expertise and experience in mitigating the harms associated with the threat of financial crime at a strategic level.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * An excellent understanding of data science, advanced analytics methodologies, and technological tools used in big data analysis.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * An inherent and deep understanding and experience in using anecdotal, indicative or otherwise incomplete intelligence findings to draw strategic context and conclusions, and presenting those findings orally and in writing to senior stakeholders to drive strategic and tactical decisions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * An excellent understanding of the current regulatory environment and expectations, relevant regulations, codes, and HSBC Group Standards, as well as their underlying purpose to mitigate risk to the financial system and provide information useful for the public sector to provide law enforcement and security.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Significant leadership experience and an experienced strategic thinker.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Excellent communication and inter-personal skills, with experience of dealing with executives at all levels.
        <br/>
        <br/>
