        About the Unit
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Join us in transforming cancer research.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Center for Data Intensive Science is developing the emerging field of data science with a focus on applications to problems in biology, medicine, and health care. Our vision is a world in which researchers have ready access to the data and tools required to make discoveries that lead to deeper understanding and improved quality of life. We democratize access, speed discovery, create new knowledge and foster innovation through implementation using data at scale. Our scientific data clouds and commons include:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a next generation unified system that supports the hosting and standardization of genomic and clinical data from cancer research programs. The GDC provides the cancer research community with a data service supporting the receipt, quality control, integration, storage, and redistribution of standardized cancer genomic data sets derived from cancer studies. This is the foundation of a genomic precision medicine platform and will enable the development of a knowledge system for cancer. The GDC is an open-source, scalable, modern informatics framework that enables previously infeasible collaborative efforts between scientists.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud is an analysis plastform for bioinformatics at scale. Bionimbus is the first open-source cloud-based computational platform that allows researchers authorized by NIH to compute over human genomic data in a secure and compliant fashion. Bionimbus and related cloud-based infrastructure are used by researchers working on cancer, diabetes and neuropsychiatric disorders.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC) provides the scientific community with resources for storing, sharing, and analyzing terabyte- and petabyte-scale scientific datasets. The OSDC is a data science ecosystem in which researchers can house and share their own scientific data, access complementary public datasets, build and share customized virtual machines with whatever tools necessary to analyze their data, and perform the analysis to answer their research questions. The OSDC is a collaboration with the not-for-profit Open Cloud Consortium.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Biomedical Data Commons (BDC) is cloud-based infrastructure that we are developing for a consortium of medical research centers and commercial partners who provides secure, compliant cloud services for managing and analyzing genomic data, electronic medical records (EMR), medical images, and other PHI data. It provides resources to researchers so they can more easily make discoveries from large, complex controlled-access datasets.The BDC is a collaboration with the not-for-profit Open Cloud Consortium.
