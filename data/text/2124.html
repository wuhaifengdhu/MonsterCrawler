        Job Summary
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is looking for a Chief Theorist in materials science to build on its strong tradition in the application of advanced theory and computation to problems in renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as emerging programs in the integration of theory and experiment to accelerate materials discovery and development. The candidate would also be the group leader of a theory group within the Materials and Chemical Science and Technology Directorate, responsible for technical leadership, management and professional development of solid-state theorists.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We seek highly motivated candidates with a demonstrated track record to contribute to current programs and with a vision to develop new programs and new directions in materials science theory. We seek candidates with a deep knowledge of fundamental theoretical science and its application to important problems in materials science, with the capability and interest to work across the fundamental and applied energy space. Candidates should have a demonstrated ability to initiate and execute programs in areas related to NREL's mission and broad research portfolio. The successful candidate will develop and apply predictive theories and new theoretical methods to the study of novel functional materials with properties relevant to energy conversion, storage, utilization or efficiency and will work closely with NREL senior management, theorists and experimentalists to develop and execute new research directions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Research areas would utilize high performance computing to address electronic, structural, vibrational, optical, or magnetic phenomena and properties of materials at the atomic, nano- or meso- scale. Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, materials discovery, opto-electronic materials, functional materials, quantum materials, strongly correlated electron systems, or dynamic phenomena, including transport of atoms, charge or spin, as well as phenomena on ultrafast time scales. The position will likely involve a joint appointment at one of the universities within the Colorado front range.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Excluded research areas are those focusing exclusively on organic materials, soft matter, and biophysics.
