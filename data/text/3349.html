        Berkeley Lab (LBNL) addresses the world's most urgent scientific challenges by advancing sustainable energy, protecting human health, creating new materials, and revealing the origin and fate of the universe. Founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab's scientific expertise has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes. The University of California manages Berkeley Lab for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Position Summary:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Data Science and Technology (DST) department (dst.lbl.gov) in the Computational Research Division (crd.lbl.gov) is looking for talented and motivated post-doctoral researchers to be part of our team focused on conceiving, developing, and applying leading-edge, innovative methods for solving data-intensive science problems. The DST department projects span a diverse set of activities, ranging from data management; data movement; statistical, topological, and geometric analysis; computer vision; visualization; user-interface design; usability; and end-to-end data-intensive system architecture and deployment. Our program activities range from basic and applied research, to deployment of software tools and systems. This position is a unique opportunity to engage in leading-edge research and development activities as part of a multidisciplinary team that has direct engagements with active science projects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our collaborators are from across the science disciplines, ranging from theoretical astrophysicists to computational and experimental bioscientists. The capabilities we build are driven by the needs of contemporary computational, observational, and experimental science projects central to the mission of the DOE Office of Science. Our portfolio includes projects in basic and applied research, advanced software development, and deployment to the scientific community. The science challenges we are helping to understand include: understanding carbon interactions between the atmosphere and the biome, interpreting results from trillion-particle space weather simulations, detecting extreme weather events in climate models, locating halo particles in accelerator models, understanding organism function, detecting blobs in fusion experiments while the data is in transit, and understanding ways to make the energy grid more resilient.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The successful candidate will join one of the four DST groups. These groups and their mission/focus are listed below:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Data Analytics and Visualization (DAV) group is focused on enabling scientific researchers in achieving their knowledge discovery goals through visualization and analysis. They develop new capabilities in high performance and data-intensive visualization, analysis, and related (data-intensive) technologies. All our scientific collaborators have a theme in common: the need to understand complex systems through visual inspection of results from simulation and experiment/observation.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Integrated Data Frameworks (IDF) group performs research and development focused on integrated high-throughput simulation environments in three primary areas: (1) Data processing and analytics algorithms and pipelines for moderate-scale observation and simulation environments; (2) Optimization of data movement and management, which utilizes next generation networking and data management solutions; and (3) Optimizing and modeling of scientific workflows.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Scientific Data Management (SDM) group develops technologies and tools for efficient data access and storage management of massive scientific data sets. The SDM group is currently developing data querying technologies, in situ feature extraction algorithms, along with software platforms for exascale data. The group works closely with application scientists to address their data processing challenges. All these activities are backed by active research efforts in developing novel algorithms on emerging hardware platforms.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Usable Software Systems (USS) group is focused on usability aspects of computational and data analysis systems. UCS researchers are involved in three primary research and development mission areas a) user-centered design processes that work in scientific environments, b) usable scientific workflow tools and data abstractions, and c) intuitive interfaces to explore, analyze, process data and run computations on HPC and distributed systems.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The successful candidate will have excellent oral and written communication skills; have a strong technical background in one or more areas of data science and/or data infrastructure engineering; be able to work effectively both in an independent fashion as well as part of a team; and have software development skills in some of the technology areas listed below.
