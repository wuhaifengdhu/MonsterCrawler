        Genscape's product offerings are focused on energy data which is captured via patented sensor technology. Beyond our revolutionary sensor IP, Genscape's offerings are all software/data-based product. The essence of all our commercial products are the result of some of the most talented software engineers in the market. We continue to expand our software suite through organic development and integration of acquired products, technologies &amp; data. We have just launched an entirely new unified platform that is a complete re-architect and rebuild of the entire system—not simply a refactor and/or extension but rather a comprehensive next gen system. We are further evolving that platform to extend into machine learning, data visualization including augmented reality and mobile.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To continue to build on the success of the product strategy and the next gen platform delivery, Genscape is seeking to hire a team lead to cover the application development of our consolidated software engineering team. This role will report to the MD of Platform &amp; Shared Services. This is a senior role focused on the continued delivery of software via a team of talented application developers operating in a number of SCRUM teams today. This role requires collaboration across the rest of the technology leadership team to ensure alignment with the roadmaps of work streams including database development, devops, business intelligence, QA and architecture.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This team lead will work with the across the organization in planning, design, development, testing, and deployment of application services. This individual will need to be a strong collaborator and communicator as they will work closely with the Product Developers to ensure that the engineers' activities are in line with the larger goals of Genscape's growth strategy. This individual will also work with the other members of the Platform team to establish and maintain design standards to ensure compatibility and consistency in all data environments.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The role is a hybrid of manager and hands-on technologist working through architecture and also code-related work streams. Leading a global team on a day-to-day basis requires the hands-on co-development/code review activities to provide code-level guidance while also leading from a SCRUM/Agile delivery perspective. The role requires an in-depth understanding of code management activities and agile deployment methods where we maintain multiple environments across Dev, QA, Test, Beta, Prod, etc.. while servicing may products with one production platform. The activities also include working with our devops team on the continual optimization of continuous integration. Our new production platform is cloud-based and highly scalable which is essential for our platform strategy to deliver all products across one configurable platform. There are a variety of technologies we employ with the vast majority being open-source across the full stack of our cloud-based platform. The Lead will manage development activities with the full spectrum of technologies however our data services team has accountability for the data tier and we include our database resources with our daily SCRUM standups. This leadership role will also incorporate and embrace our off-shore partners working around the globe to leverage their dev &amp; QA skills on the SCRUM teams. Support activities will also come into the role however our platform's architecture mitigates many of the typical risks seen in vertical product solutions so break-fix will be only a small portion of the job. Our Devops group handles the majority of support however some issues will escalate to the team lead role to address urgent issues with the team.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We enjoy engineers who love to innovate and are remarkably passionate about software development in all layers of the stack. Exceptional software developers are as much left- as they are right-brain thinkers given the nature of design and development. Passion for software, drive toward excellence of solution and outstanding team collaboration where ideas can be bounced around for feedback are all aspects of culture we embrace. If you see software as a direct reflection of what you love to do/build and if you say to yourself: "Imagine… I get PAID to do what I love---explore, innovate and develop excellent software with awesome technologies," then please do come talk to us for this role and/or other roles we have at Genscape.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We look for passionate technologists who love data as well as enjoy working in an autonomous environment where employees are encouraged to expand their careers, explore new ideas, and make a big impact where they work. Come see what we are all about!

We embrace SCRUM and bi-weekly sprints and that the energy to deliver comes from accountability and self-motivation. We don't believe in punching a clock and at the same time we do believe in delivery, commitment to team, commitment to individual and a career plan that rewards excellence and high standards/work ethic. We leave it up to you and offer very attractive incentives to reward such excellence and delivery throughput.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It would be a huge bonus if you embrace some or all of the following:

        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Exposure to Cloud based PaaS and IaaS services including SQL Azure, AWS RDS, or SQL Server on cloud based VMs. We dual-home our cloud solutions so enjoy both Azure and AWS as well as some niche providers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once you land this position, you'll get to enjoy:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * A fun, fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where employees are viewed as the company's greatest asset and critical to our success. The culture of our technology group has gone from good to great as we've consolidated our team so that we're fully aligned on strategy and operations. This has been a huge benefit to our culture.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Technology culture fostered and evolved by technologists and for technologists: Annual Tech Summit where we assemble the entire global technology team for a week to communicate our direction for the upcoming year, identifying new technologies, prioritizing products and how we evolve our process/team tools/etc…
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Global Collaboration: Video conferencing as well as mobile camera bots where remote employees can explore/interact throughout our open work space and into (hopefully invited) team meetings and doing so across many cultures. We also support community gaming however we find that most folks enjoy coding more than they do gaming! Go figure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Culture of 'Who we are as technologists': We are not the often over-used term of "IT" but rather we are Software Engineers forming the core of all product built and sold by Genscape. We are not a 'support function' in a retail, consumer or other hard-products business. Rather but rather are at the center of all that is created within Genscape which is software---not as a support function but developers are the core of all that is created at Genscape. We bring to life the product concepts, vision and details of world-class Energy product managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which is the perfect combination and one reason for build of quality product.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Being part of a team of extremely talented analysts, engineers, technologists, data scientists, user experience experts, QA practitioners and off-shore strategic development teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * A company that offers a strong focus on work life balance and encouragement to make a big impact where you work. As previously mentioned, many of our talent pool are both left-and-right brain balanced and are as comfortable at a keyboard cranking code as they are composing music, rock-climbing, leading a band, restoring snow cats, welding artwork or many other interesting hobbies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We also support working from home and flexible work hours: This goes to supporting the self-motivated team member where we want folks who enjoy going 'above-and-beyond' as a standard because they simply 'are that way'. The result is high throughput, consistent delivery and a happy team!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Excellent benefits and numerous perks including conferences, F2F training, online training and internal contests such as Technology Hackathons and Internal Innovation Competitions where we bring winning team concepts to life in product/technology.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We offer all of the above (and more) as we know you expect the most of us as a company and managers and we expect the most of you as an exceptional contributor! Apply if you want to join as an exceptional contributor to an awesome team---if you are looking for just another 'job in technology' and are at all a 'clock-puncher' then please pass on us.
