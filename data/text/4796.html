        The Data Systems Engineering Group is looking for qualified Research and Development Computer Engineering candidates interested in collaborating within a high performing team on next generation technologies to provide solutions to national security applications. The group engineers and delivers technology solutions across the entire spectrum of mission data (producers, consumers, transport, and analysis). These solutions are a mix of hardware and software. Hardware design challenges range from microcontrollers to high performance computing networks and software design challenges range from binary microcode to high-level application and system solutions. Also in the design mix is FPGA firmware development in VHDL or Verilog and signal processing of images and sensor data in both hardware and software. Computer Engineers in group 2660 deliver systems to the customer base accompanied with a qualification and testing pedigree that provides assurance the system will function in the intended environment for the purpose of the mission. Applicants will also have opportunities to propose and participate in internal research and development efforts. Successful candidates will gain experience in embedded hardware and software design, signal processing algorithm development for NW and Radar instrumentation, Missile Defense control systems, network security, pattern recognition and data analytics for sensors, and work with "systems on a chip".

        Security Clearance
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Position requires a Department of Energy (DOE) granted Q-level security clearance.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sandia is required by DOE directive to conduct a pre-employment background review that includes personal reference checks, law enforcement record and credit checks, and employment and education verifications. Applicants for employment must be able to obtain and maintain a DOE Q-level security clearance, which requires U.S. citizenship.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Applicants offered employment with Sandia are subject to a federal background investigation to meet the requirements for access to classified information or matter if the duties of the position require a DOE security clearance. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause a clearance to be denied or terminated by the DOE, rendering the inability to perform the duties assigned and resulting in termination of employment.
