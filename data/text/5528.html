        POSITION SUMMARY:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Individuals in the Data scientist role provide overall direction, guidance, definition and facilitation for the development of an architecture (current and future state) required to meet business strategies and goals. Responsibilities include advocacy and support of the enterprise's IT strategies, identification and analysis of enterprise business drivers to derive useful business context, analysis of the current IT environment to detect critical deficiencies and recommend solutions for improvement, and the development of strategies aligning IT to business.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Data scientists interface across all business areas, acting as visionaries to proactively assist in defining the direction for future projects. They conceive strategies, solutions, build consensus, and sell/execute solutions. They are involved in all aspects of the project life cycle, from the initial kickoff through the requirements analysis, design and implementation. Additional responsibilities may include the establishment of the overall architectural viewpoints and the establishment and oversight of organization standards and policies. Architects identify major system interfaces, business capabilities needs, and existing architecture weaknesses and opportunities for systems.

        <br/>
        Serving in this role requires an individual to be a self-starter, work independently, and as a team member.
