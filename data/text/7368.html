        At Capital One, we're building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.
        <br/>

We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing.

        Senior Manager of Data Science, Tech College
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Capital One Overview
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. Our goal is simple – bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to an industry ripe for change. Together, we will build one of America's leading information-based technology companies. We may be a bank, but we think and operate like a tech company. A tech company that writes its own code, develops its own software, and builds its own products. A tech company that experiments and innovates with the latest technologies, engineer's breakthrough customer experiences, and brings simplicity and humanity to banking. Join us.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tech College Overview
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We are creating something unique and unprecedented, a re-imagined hub for technology training, as a bold investment in developing our associates and leaders, recruiting top technical and non-technical talent, and continuing to differentiate ourselves in the market. As a Senior Manager, Data Science of the Tech College within the Tech College, you'll be part of a team responsible for analyzing, designing, and developing highly engaging learning experiences and solutions that will fuel our growth as a Tech company and help our associates develop cutting-edge skills.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you have a passion for helping others learn and build next-generation skills by creating amazing learning experiences, you may be a fit for our team. We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Tech College. As a member of this team, you will work in a rapid and agile environment, and have the opportunity to build technical training curricula from the ground-up.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On any given day you'll be:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Using Big Data tools (Hadoop, Spark, H2O, AWS) to conduct the analysis of billions of customer transaction records
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Integrating with external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Building machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Creating or curating educational content to help your Capital One peers stay on top of the Data Science tools and techniques.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Ideal Candidate will be:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and you're constantly exploring new open source tools.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Wrangler. You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into human-readable form (ROC curve, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Creative. Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You're used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it's still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you've ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.
        <br/>
