        At Capital One, we're building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Data Scientist Senior Manager
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As a Data Scientist with Credit Review, you'll be part of a team that provides assurance relative to credit risk by independently identifying, assessing and escalating credit risk to the Board of Directors and other key stakeholders. You will be instrumental in the team's vision of delivering game changing assurance solutions as Capital One grows. At Capital One, you'll be part of a team that's leading the next wave of disruption on a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On any given day you'll be:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Reviewing and independently testing the effectiveness and accuracy of Commercial Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, and Exposure at Default models from development through validation and production usage, directly impacting our Commercial banking relationships
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Writing software to investigate and replicate data transformations and handling of messy data sets of numerical and textual data
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Utilizing expertise in models that leverage the newest data sources, technologies, and tools, such as machine learning, Python, Hadoop, Spark, H20, AWS, as well as other cutting-edge tools and applications for Big Data.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Investigating the impact of new technologies, applications, and data sources on the future credit environment
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Identifying opportunities to automate and standardize model reporting and validation tools
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to business partners, company leaders, and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Managing Agile based Credit Review Targeted Reviews of Commercial modeling practices and risk management
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Writing executive reports and formulating issues based on fieldwork and analyses, then ensuring that corrective actions are implemented per agreed upon timelines
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Ideal Candidate will be:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and you're constantly exploring new open source tools.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Wrangler. You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into human-readable form (ROC curve, map, d3 visualization, Tableau)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Creative. Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You're used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it's still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you've ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.
