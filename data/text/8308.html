        At Capital One, we're building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
        <br/>

        Senior User Experience Researcher
        <br/>

        We want to change the way people engage with their money, their bank, and their financial lives. It's audacious work at a massive scale.

        * Actively monitor and analyze research, data, and trends from internal sources, academic research, and industry published reports to inform and improve our research methods
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Effectively and intelligently influence the iteration of designs by pinpointing key data points from testing, reviews, etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Present and communicate research and analysis clearly and effectively across various organizations in any format required. Able to sell, support, explain, and simply present usability approach and research to various audience types from sophisticated design experts to non-designers
